    	message = Now that you've accepted the contract, you'll have to manually warp for 4 years. Once done, you will be awarded with all tech nodes prior to 1955 and enough money to buy some basic upgrades (Tracking Station level 2 strongly recommended). You will also be given 20 science points (and consequently 1 KCT upgrade point) to compensate for the absence of atmospheric science.
